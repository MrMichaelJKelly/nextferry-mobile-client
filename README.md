Next Ferry (html5 mobile interface)
=================

This repository is the front end to the NextFerry application (https://github.com/denised/nextferry.git).

This is developed in html5 / cordova / jquery, built with the Telerik Appbuilder IDE (http://telerik.com).
It might be somewhat interesting in that it uses no additional "big" infrastructure libraries (no jquery mobile, angular, etc.).
